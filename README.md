Description

It is time to start learning Javascript DOM Manipulation! The main topics we learned in javascript this week were: Traversing the DOM, Setting Attricutes, Appending to the HTML, Time Intervals, On Click functions, Preventing Default Events, Event bubbling and saving to your Local Storage.

The process of creating a quiz via Javascript is more complicated than you think. What helped me with this assignment is psuedocoding. I wrote out step by step what needed to be done, and then translated those steps into code. To begin, you must create your HTML sheet with all potential div tags you will be calling throughout the quiz. Once you have your HTML all set up, it is time to decorate your HTMl with CSS styling. I did not add much styling in this assignment, but it was important for me to center and straighten up all of the content so it would be appealing to the eye. Now comes the hard stuff. It is important to take javascript step by step. I first created javascript ID's for every ID div tag placed in the HTML. Once I set those tags to variables, I created my main 4 functions (GenerateQuizFunction, Start Quiz, Check Answer and Show scores). One of the most important taks this assignment was to create and array of objects. Once I had all of my information in an array, I was able to pull from each object line to create my quiz content. It was challenging trying to find out what information to place in what function. Once the quiz content was set up, it was time to set values to each of the question options to create a final score tally.

It is important as a future developer to be able to create dynmaic elements via user input. This whole project was based off of user input and how to manipulate the DOM. It is important to learn the basics of Javascript to be able to build more complex and dynamic developments later on.

Potential future projects for this assignment could be able to add more questions the more answers the user gets right. Or a potential project to piggy back off of this assignment could be to add true and false questions in with the multiple choice.
